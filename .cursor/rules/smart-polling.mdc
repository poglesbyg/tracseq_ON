# smart-polling

Based on the provided specification, there is very limited direct information about the smart-polling implementation. The available technical documentation does not contain explicit details about:

- Polling intervals
- State management for polling
- Activity detection algorithms 
- Smart polling optimization logic

The database schema suggests some timestamp tracking via `updated_at` triggers which could potentially be used as part of a polling system, but specific polling logic is not documented.

Importance Score: N/A (insufficient information to score)

$END$

Note: While the specification mentions database timestamps and status tracking, there is not enough concrete information about smart-polling implementation details to provide comprehensive documentation of this aspect.
