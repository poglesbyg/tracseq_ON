# Smart Polling

The smart polling system implements dynamic polling intervals based on user activity and data state changes.

## Core Components

### SmartPollingProvider
Location: `/apps/web/src/components/providers/smart-polling-provider.tsx`
- Manages polling state across the application
- Tracks user activity patterns to optimize request frequency
- Provides polling context to child components

### Polling Hook
Location: `/apps/web/src/hooks/use-smart-polling.ts`
- Exposes polling control interface
- Handles interval adjustments based on activity detection
- Maintains polling lifecycle 

## Business Logic

### Activity-Based Interval Management
- Active intervals: Fast polling during active user interaction
- Idle intervals: Reduced polling frequency during inactive periods
- Suspended state: Paused polling when tab is inactive

### Domain Rules
- Maximum polling interval: 60 seconds
- Minimum polling interval: 5 seconds 
- Activity timeout: 15 minutes before entering idle state
- Grace period: 30 seconds before reducing poll frequency

Business Impact Score: 75
- Critical for real-time data synchronization
- Directly impacts user experience and server load
- Domain-specific activity detection patterns
