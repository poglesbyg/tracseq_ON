### Core Domain Tables

The database schema implements specialized tables for CRISPR experiment management:

1. `experiments`
- Tracks CRISPR design projects
- Status workflow: draft → analyzing → completed → archived 
- Associates experiments with user ownership
- Importance: 95

2. `sequences`
- Stores validated DNA sequences
- Enforces ATCGN pattern validation
- Records genomic coordinates and strand information
- Importance: 90

3. `guide_rnas`
- Captures designed guide RNA data
- Stores PAM sites and scoring metrics
- Tracks algorithm metadata and versions
- Importance: 85

4. `off_target_sites`
- Records predicted off-target binding locations
- Mismatch analysis and position tracking
- Risk scoring for each site
- Importance: 80

5. `analysis_results`
- Flexible JSONB storage for computational results
- Algorithm parameters and metrics
- Experiment association
- Importance: 75

### Data Validation Rules

Domain-specific validation includes:
- DNA sequence pattern matching against ATCGN
- Score range validation (0-1)
- UUID relationship validation
- Experiment status transitions

### Domain Relationships

- Experiments contain multiple sequences
- Guide RNAs associate with specific sequences
- Off-target sites link to guide RNAs
- Analysis results connect to experiments
