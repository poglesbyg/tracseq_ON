# data-models

## Core Domain Models

### Experiment Schema
- Location: `packages/db/src/types.ts`
- Domain-specific fields for CRISPR experiments:
  - Guide RNA sequences
  - Target DNA sequences
  - Off-target analysis results
  - Efficiency scores
  - Batch processing metadata

### User Authentication Model
- Location: `packages/db/src/types.gen.ts`
- Lab-specific user roles and permissions
- Access control for sensitive genetic data
- Experiment ownership tracking

### Data Relationships
- Location: `packages/api/src/actions/experiments`

Key associations:
- Experiments to Users (many-to-one)
- Guide RNAs to Experiments (many-to-one)
- Analysis Results to Experiments (one-to-many)

## Domain-Specific Fields

### Guide RNA Records
- Sequence validation rules
- PAM site requirements
- GC content constraints
- Efficiency scoring metrics
- Off-target binding predictions

### Analysis Results
- Cutting frequency determinations
- MIT specificity scores
- Risk assessment categories
- Gene context annotations

Importance Scores:
- Core Schema Design: 95 (Critical domain models)
- Authentication Model: 85 (Lab-specific security)
- Data Relationships: 80 (Experiment tracking)
- Field Validations: 75 (Domain rules)
