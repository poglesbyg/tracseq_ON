# crispr-algorithms

Based on the provided specification, the CRISPR algorithm documentation appears to be primarily focused around:

## Algorithm Components
- GC content calculation for guide RNA sequences
- PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif) site identification 
- Guide RNA scoring mechanisms
- Off-target filtering logic

## Integration Points
The algorithms interface with the `guide_rnas` and `off_target_sites` tables for:
- Storing designed guide RNAs with PAM sites
- Recording efficiency scores
- Tracking specificity metrics
- Maintaining on-target scoring
- Capturing algorithm metadata and versioning

## Analysis Storage
Results from the CRISPR algorithms are persisted in the `analysis_results` table using:
- JSONB format for flexibility
- Algorithm parameters storage
- Performance metrics tracking

## Score Validation
The system enforces validation rules for algorithm outputs:
- Score ranges must be between 0-1
- DNA sequence patterns must match ATCGN format

Importance Score: 95 (Core domain algorithms for CRISPR guide RNA design)
