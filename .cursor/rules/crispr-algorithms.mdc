## Core Guide RNA Design Logic
- `/lims-ai/src/guide_optimization.py`
- `/src/lib/crispr/guide-design.ts`

Key algorithms for guide RNA sequence optimization:
- GC content calculation with 40-60% optimal range validation
- PAM site identification for SpCas9, SpCas9-NG, and Cas12a systems
- Position-weighted scoring matrix for guide efficiency
- Nucleotide composition rules for optimal guide design

**Importance Score: 95** - Critical core business logic for CRISPR functionality

## Sequence Analysis Engine 
- `/lims-ai/src/sequence_analysis.py`

Specialized DNA sequence evaluation:
- Secondary structure prediction for guide RNA
- Challenge identification in target sequences
- Risk factor assessment for sequence modifications
- Custom validation rules for DNA patterns (ATCGN)

**Importance Score: 90** - Essential domain-specific analysis

## Off-Target Assessment
- `/src/lib/crispr/off-target-prediction.ts`

Domain-specific scoring mechanisms:
- CFD (Cutting Frequency Determination) algorithm
- MIT specificity score calculation
- Position-weighted mismatch penalties
- Gene context impact analysis
- Risk categorization for potential off-target sites

**Importance Score: 85** - Critical safety and accuracy component

## Batch Processing Pipeline
- `/src/lib/crispr/batch-processing.ts`

Multi-sequence processing:
- Parallel guide RNA validation
- Aggregate scoring system
- Domain-specific sequence validation rules
- Result aggregation with biological context

**Importance Score: 75** - Important workflow optimization
