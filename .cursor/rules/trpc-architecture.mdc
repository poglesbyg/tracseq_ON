# trpc-architecture

The tRPC implementation provides type-safe communication between the frontend and backend services with domain-specific procedures:

## Core Router Configuration

### Experiment Management Router (`packages/api/src/routers/experiments.ts`)
- Custom procedures for CRISPR guide sequence validation
- Batch analysis workflow coordination 
- Experiment metadata validation and enrichment
- Integration with AI analysis pipeline

### User Context Router (`packages/api/src/routers/user.ts`) 
- Lab-specific authorization rules
- Experiment ownership and access control
- Research group management

## Middleware Components

### API Context (`packages/api/src/context.ts`)
- Lab session validation
- Equipment access verification
- Sample tracking integration

### Domain-Specific Procedures

Located in `packages/api/src/actions/`:

**Experiments:**
- Guide RNA design validation
- Off-target analysis coordination
- Batch processing state management
- AI analysis result handling

**Users:**
- Lab access level verification
- Equipment certification checks
- Research protocol compliance

## Integration Points

### Client Configuration (`apps/web/src/client/trpc.ts`)
- AI service connection management
- Real-time analysis updates
- Batch operation coordination

### API Endpoint (`apps/web/src/pages/api/trpc/[trpc].ts`)
- CRISPR workflow orchestration
- Analysis pipeline routing
- Result transformation handlers

Importance Scores:
- Experiment Management Router: 95 (Core CRISPR analysis workflows)
- Domain-Specific Procedures: 90 (Critical business validation)
- Lab Context Middleware: 85 (Research integrity enforcement)
- Integration Points: 75 (Workflow coordination)
