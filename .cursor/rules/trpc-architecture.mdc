## Core API Structure

The tRPC architecture implements experiment management workflows through type-safe procedures:

### Experiments Router
Handles CRISPR experiment lifecycle with specialized endpoints for:
- Experiment creation with metadata and ownership tracking
- Status transitions (draft → analyzing → completed → archived)
- Nested resource management for sequences and guide RNAs
- Off-target analysis result storage

### Data Validation Layer
Domain-specific validation rules enforced through Zod schemas:
- DNA sequence pattern validation (ATCGN)
- Score range constraints (0-1) for efficiency metrics
- UUID relationship validation between experiments and components

### API Workflow Integration
- Sequence submission workflow with experiment context
- Guide RNA design persistence pipeline
- Off-target analysis results storage in JSONB format

Importance Score: 85 - Critical for maintaining data integrity and experiment workflow management
