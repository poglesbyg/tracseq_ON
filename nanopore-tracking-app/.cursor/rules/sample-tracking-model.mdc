### Sample Status Workflow
Importance Score: 95

The system implements a multi-stage sample tracking workflow:

1. Primary Status States:
- submitted → prep → sequencing → analysis → completed → archived

2. Priority Classification:
- Four-tier priority system: low, normal, high, urgent
- Priority affects sample queue positioning and processing order

3. Core Sample Metadata:
- Unique identifiers following HTSF/NANO/SEQ prefixed patterns
- Sample concentration values (ng/μL)
- DNA/RNA purity ratios
- Fragment size measurements
- Flow cell type specifications

### Processing Timeline Model
Importance Score: 90

Standardized 8-step workflow with defined durations:
1. Sample QC (1h)
2. Library Preparation (4h)
3. Library QC (1h)
4. Sequencing Setup (1h)
5. Sequencing Run (48h)
6. Basecalling (2h)
7. Quality Assessment (1h)
8. Data Delivery (1h)

Each step tracks:
- Assignment status
- Start/completion timestamps
- Duration metrics
- Completion status
- Quality control checkpoints

### Validation Framework
Importance Score: 85

Domain-specific validation rules for sample tracking:
- Concentration range verification
- Purity ratio thresholds
- Fragment size compliance
- Flow cell compatibility checks
- Required field completeness validation
