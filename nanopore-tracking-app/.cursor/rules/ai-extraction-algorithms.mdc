# ai-extraction-algorithms

The AI extraction pipeline implements specialized logic for processing nanopore sequencing forms and metadata:

## Core Extraction Pipeline
**Importance: 95**
- Multi-stage extraction process combining LLM and pattern matching
- Located in `src/lib/ai/nanopore-llm-service.ts`
- Primary stages:
  1. LLM-based field extraction
  2. Pattern matching fallback
  3. RAG enhancement for accuracy
  4. Confidence scoring per field

## Field Validation Rules
**Importance: 90**
- Domain-specific validation for nanopore sequencing fields:
  - Sample concentrations with unit validation (ng/Î¼L)
  - DNA/RNA purity ratio ranges
  - Fragment size requirements
  - Flow cell type compatibility checks
- Located in `src/lib/ai/rag-system.ts`

## RAG Enhancement System
**Importance: 85**
- Field mapping system covering 19 domain-specific fields
- Semantic similarity matching for form field identification
- Confidence scoring based on:
  - Extraction method used
  - Field validation results
  - Pattern matching confidence
- Located in `src/lib/ai/rag-system.ts`

## PDF Metadata Processing
**Importance: 80**
- Specialized extraction for nanopore sequencing metadata
- Integration with sequencing workflow validation
- Located in `src/lib/ai/pdf-text-extraction.ts`

## Recommendations Engine
**Importance: 75**
- AI-driven analysis for:
  - Missing required fields
  - Field validation issues
  - Data quality improvements
- Generates specific recommendations based on nanopore sequencing requirements
