## Core Workflow Steps
Importance Score: 95

The nanopore sequencing workflow consists of 8 standardized steps:

1. Sample QC (1h)
   - Initial quality control validation
   - Concentration and purity measurements

2. Library Preparation (4h)
   - DNA/RNA library construction
   - Adapter ligation verification

3. Library QC (1h)
   - Quality metrics validation
   - Fragment size analysis

4. Sequencing Setup (1h)
   - Flow cell preparation
   - Device configuration

5. Sequencing Run (48h)
   - Active sequencing monitoring
   - Real-time data collection

6. Basecalling (2h)
   - Raw signal conversion
   - Initial sequence assembly

7. Quality Assessment (1h)
   - Read quality metrics
   - Coverage analysis

8. Data Delivery (1h)
   - Results packaging
   - Data transfer validation

## State Transitions
Importance Score: 85

Workflow progression follows strict state transitions:
- submitted → prep → sequencing → analysis → completed → archived
- Each transition requires validation of completion criteria
- Priority levels affect transition timing: low, normal, high, urgent

## Validation Rules
Importance Score: 80

Step-specific validation requirements:
- Sample QC: Concentration thresholds (ng/μL), purity ratios
- Library QC: Fragment size ranges, adapter presence
- Sequencing: Flow cell performance metrics
- Quality Assessment: Read quality scores, coverage depth
