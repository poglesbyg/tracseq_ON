## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The LIMS Microservice System implements an AI-driven laboratory management platform specialized for CRISPR gene editing and analysis. The system is organized into three core business domains:

1. AI-Driven Analysis Platform
- Sequence Analysis Engine (/lims-ai/src/sequence_analysis.py)
  - DNA sequence evaluation
  - GC content optimization
  - Risk factor assessment
  
- Guide RNA Optimization System (/lims-ai/src/guide_optimization.py)
  - Secondary structure prediction
  - Off-target risk evaluation
  - Sequence modification suggestions

2. CRISPR Design & Analysis
- Guide RNA Design Engine (/lims-core/src/validation.rs)
  - Pattern validation for DNA sequences
  - Score range validation
  - Domain-specific rules enforcement

- Experiment Management (/lims-ai/src/experiment_suggestions.py)
  - Protocol optimizations
  - Risk mitigation strategies
  - Literature-based recommendations

3. Laboratory Integration Layer
- Data Transformation Pipeline (/lims-ai/src/data_transformation.py)
  - Bioinformatics workflow processing
  - Guide RNA scoring
  - Off-target site analysis

- Fallback Systems (/lims-ai/src/fallback_system.py)
  - Algorithmic analysis backup
  - Graceful AI degradation
  - Rule-based recommendations

Core Business Components:
- CRISPR Studio (/apps/web/src/components/crispr/crispr-studio.tsx)
- Guide RNA Design System (/src/lib/crispr/guide-design.ts)
- Off-Target Analysis Engine (/src/lib/crispr/off-target-prediction.ts)
- Batch Processing System (/src/lib/crispr/batch-processing.ts)

The system integrates these components through a microservices architecture, with each service handling specific aspects of the CRISPR analysis and laboratory management workflow.
